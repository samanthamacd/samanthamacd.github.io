# Goal   

I've always held an active interest in politics, especially that of the United States. As I've progressed in obtaining my Bachelors in Statistics, it has become an even more present part in my life due to the scientific nature of politics, specifically voting and elections. That's why, in choosing my final project for STAT 386, going the political route seemed quite obvious. In my EDA (which will come in a post to follow!), I hope to explore the relationship between age demographics and election results from 2000-2022, which is a span of time that has experienced immense voter turnouts, especially from increasingly younger age groups. 

# Finding the Data  
This is where my dear friend, ChatGPT comes into play. ALthough an imperfect AI (which most are), I believe that having it dig through search engines for you to save you time is one of the best ways to take advantage of tools such as these. Chat's response led me to electionproject.org, which gave me national and state turnout rates from 2000 up to last year (although the website itself has data going back to 1787!). I also found KFF.org using ChatGPT, which gave me data on voting age demographics for elections from 2014. 

# Is this Ethical?  
A huge part of statistics and data analysis is ensuring that what you're studying, or the data you're gathering, is done so ethically. Although an EDA doesn't require extensive data collection on my part, I still want to see that the data I'm using is public information and contains nothing that could damage the subjects within the data. Here, since I am looking at voter turnout numbers by state, along with age demographics, there is no private, personal information that I need to protect. The websites that I'm using also give you options to download (and therefore use) their data, so I also have no qualms about using the data from these websites. 


# How I Did It: 
Because I have two different resources for my EDA data, I am going to talk about the process of reading them in and wrangling the data for each resource individually. 

### 1. Voter Turnout Data 
As with any python project, you must start with loading any necessary libraries. 

``````
import pandas as pd 
import time 
import numpy as np 
import requests 
``````
The voter turnout data that I found is actually quite simple to read in because they're accessible to download in CSV format. Using 'pandas', I read in 12 different data sets for voter turnout for Presidential and Midterm election years from 2000. Here's an example of the midterm election information from last year: 

```````
general1 = pd.read_csv('2022General.csv') 
general1.head() 
````````

And that's it! The data is in. It's, pretty ugly though, so the real fun comes in cleaning it up! 

First, I'm going to assign column names to 'general1': 
````````
general1.columns = ['State', 'Total Ballots Counted', 'Status', 'Source', 'Preliminary Turnout Rate', 
                 'Voting-Eligible Population (VEP)', 'Voting-Age Population (VAP)', '% Non-Citizen', 'Prison', 'Probabtion', 
                 'Parole', 'Total Ineligible Felon', 'Overseas Eligible', 'State Abrv']
`````````

Followed by creating a list that identifies the winning political party for each state that year: 
```````
Party = ['N/A', 'N/A', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'N/A', 
        'Republican', 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 
         'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Republican', 
          'Republican', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Republican', 
           'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Republican','Republican','Republican','Republican','Republican','Republican','Republican',
            'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'N/A']
```````
Now that I've created the elements necessary to clean up the data, I'm going to start amending the data table to reflect the changes: 

``````
general1['Party'] = Party # assigning the 'Party' values to a new column
general1 = general1.drop(10) # dropping the row for 'District of Columbia (Sorry, DC) 
general1 = general1.drop(53) # dropping an unnecesary row at the end 
general1 = general1[1:] # exlcudes the first row (which were the columns) 
``````
And after all of that, here is my clean data frame:

Isn't that nice? Only took a week to do that x12 ;) 

### 2. Age Demographic Data
